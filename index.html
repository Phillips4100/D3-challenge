          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The association between obesity and income or educational level is complex and differs by sex and race/ethnicity.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Overall, men and women with college degrees had lower obesity prevalence compared with those with less education.</li>
            <li>By race/ethnicity, the same obesity and education pattern was seen among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic women, and also among non-Hispanic white men, although the differences were not all statistically significant. Although the difference was not statistically significant among non-Hispanic black men, obesity prevalence increased with educational attainment. Among non-Hispanic Asian women and men and Hispanic men there were no differences in obesity prevalence by education level</li>
            <li>Among men, obesity prevalence was lower in the lowest and highest income groups compared with the middle income group. This pattern was seen among non-Hispanic white and Hispanic men. Obesity prevalence was higher in the highest income group than in the lowest income group among non-Hispanic black men.</li>
            <li>Among women, obesity prevalence was lower in the highest income group than in the middle and lowest income groups. This pattern was observed among non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic women. Among non-Hispanic black women, there was no difference in obesity prevalence by income.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Cigarette smoking disproportionately affects the health of people with low SES. Lower income cigarette smokers suffer more from diseases caused by smoking than do smokers with higher incomes.5</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Populations in the most socioeconomically deprived groups have higher lung cancer risk than those in the most affluent groups.</li>
            <li>People with less than a high school education have higher lung cancer incidence than those with a college education.</li>
            <li>People with family incomes of less than $12,500 have higher lung cancer incidence than those with family incomes of $50,000 or more.</li>
            <li>Lower-income populations have less access to health care, making it more likely that they are diagnosed at later stages of diseases and conditions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Having a low-income presents a variety of problems for families and children, with access to health care being the most complex and prevalent. Although there are many challenges for low-income families to access adequate health care in the United States, the key barriers identified in this review of literature are a lack of education, complications with health insurance, and a distrust of health care providers. Each obstacle is influenced by a myriad of factors that affect vulnerable sub-groups of low-income families. Acknowledging the barriers that prevent access to health care for low-income families is the first step towards determining future sustainable solutions.</p>
